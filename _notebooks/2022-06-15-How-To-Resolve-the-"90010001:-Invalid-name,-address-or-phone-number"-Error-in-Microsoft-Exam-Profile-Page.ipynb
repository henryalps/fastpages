    "### Answer\n",
    "It is most likely that you have not filled in the address correctly, so I suggest you keep only the first line of the address.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How-to locate the problem\n",
    "1. Press F12 to open the Developer Tools;\n",
    "2. Open the \"network\" tab;\n",
    "3. Click the \"Save&Continue\" button;\n",
    "4. Check the network response, you can find a \"SaveUserMasterPofile\" item or something like that. Click it and open \"response\" subtab, the error message will tell you the real reason for the problem:\n",

    "### My thoughts\n",
    "It took me a long time to solve this problem, and I read many posts on the Microsoft website. I realized that for 3 years, Microsoft customer service has been using the same template to respond to this issue. Instead of actually helping the customer and more people with a meaningful response, the customer service was just copy and paste the template.\n",
    "![the Frustrating response](https://foam-1257577213.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/images/blog/1655284965689.png)\n",
    "But in fact Microsoft's backend developers had already provided a solution to the problem. Unfortunately, the error message on the front end was a mess, and customer service did not provide effective feedback on the issue to optimize the user experience. All in all, Microsoft does have a lot of space for UXe improvement (ironically, their OKRs definetely not include that)."
